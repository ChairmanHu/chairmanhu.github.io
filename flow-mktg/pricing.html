            <h4>What's the purpose of StoryCall?</h4>
            <p>
              StoryCall has two goals. 1 - Help our loved ones capture 
              priceless stories for future generations. 2 - Make it 
              easy for families to connect in a meaningful and fun way. 
              We're passionate about capturing stories and connecting 
              generations!

            <h4>Who are the interviewers?</h4>
            <p>
              Our interviewers come from all walks of life with one 
              thing in common &#8212; they love capturing stories from 
              elders. Our interviewers are journalists, students, moms, 
              senior living experts... the list goes on. Every 
              interviewer goes through our selection process and 
              training program. When they connect with your family, 
              they're ready to go!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Will we have the same interviewer every month?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes. That's the goal. We want them to get to know your 
              loved one over time. The only exception is if our 
              interviewer leaves the program or if you choose to 
              leave the program. Otherwise, they'll become a part of 
              the family.

            <h4>What types of questions are asked?</h4>
            <p>
              Our interviewers are equipped with all types of 
              questions. They ask about parents of your loved one, 
              hometown, childhood years, meeting their spouse, etc... 
              They also have a database of historic events that your 
              loved one may have lived through. And, most importantly, 
              family members are encouraged to ask questions, either on 
              the call or through the app.

            <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
            <p>
              Our program starts at $30/month with discounts for 
              senior living communities. There are no contracts and 
              families can cancel at any time. In short, it's very 
              affordable.

            <h4>Who has access to the site and calls?</h4>
            <p>
              Only people who are invited can join the calls and view 
              the stories. It's all private. Family members have 
              complete control.

            <h4>Can I add photos and videos to the site?</h4>
            <p>
              Not yet! Over time, there will be a series of features 
              including 'do-it-yourself' recording, photos, video, etc.

            <h4>Why can't families do this on their own?</h4>
            <p>
              They can. But it's time consuming and rarely happens. 
              StoryCall makes it easy. We take care of all the 
              reminders, saving the calls, the interview, etc... The 
              family simply schedules the call and joins. For your 
              one, it's as easy as picking up the phone.
